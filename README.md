# OpenNebula
OpenNebula is a powerful, but easy to use, open source solution to build and manage Enterprise Clouds. We are going to build an own OpenNebula on Virtual Box system (VMs) and use operating system Unbuntu version 20.04.

OpenNebula combines virtualization and container technologies with multi-tenancy, automatic provision and elasticity to offer on-demand applications and services on private, hybrid and edge environments. 

OpenNebula has been designed with flexibility in mind to help you to adapt it to the real needs of your organization and not the other way round. Below youâ€™ll find some of the basic use cases and application models that OpenNebula supports.

- Virtualized Applications
- Containerized Applications
